📊 Data Visualization Project — CodeAlpha Internship
🧩 Overview

This project was created as part of my Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha.
The goal of the project is to analyze a Sales Dataset by performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating interactive dashboards using both Excel and Tableau.

🧹 Data Cleaning (Excel)

Removed duplicates and missing values.

Standardized data formats (dates, categories, and numerical values).

Added calculated fields to support analysis.

Prepared the data for visualization in Excel and Tableau.

📄 The Excel file includes two sheets:

Cleaned_Data → contains the cleaned dataset.

Excel_Dashboard → contains the Excel-based dashboard and charts.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before visualization, I explored the dataset to understand relationships and identify trends.

Key Hypotheses Tested:

Regions with higher discounts tend to have lower profits.

The Technology category generates more profit than Furniture.

Sales increase toward the end of the year.

These hypotheses were validated through visual and statistical exploration.

📈 Data Visualization

I designed two dashboards to visualize key business insights:

Excel Dashboard: Summarized sales and profit performance by category and region.

Tableau Dashboard: Provided an interactive overview of sales trends, KPIs, and profitability.
